📊 Dynamic Table Generator

This project dynamically generates a 5x5 HTML table when the user clicks a button. Each cell displays its corresponding row and column indices. It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and table generation in JavaScript, styled with Bootstrap.

🛠 Technologies Used:

- HTML
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
- Bootstrap 5 (for styling and layout)

📁 Project Structure:

- `index.html`: 
  - Contains the HTML structure, including a `<table>` element and a button to trigger the table generation.
  - Integrates Bootstrap for table and button styling.
  
- `index.js`: 
  - JavaScript logic to:
    - Create rows (`<tr>`) and cells (`<td>`) dynamically.
    - Populate each cell with its row and column index.
    - Append the generated rows to the table.

⚡ Features:

- Dynamically generates a 5x5 table when the "Gerar tabela" button is clicked.
- Each cell displays a message like: `Celula da linha 0, coluna 0`.
- Uses Bootstrap classes (`table`, `table-striped`, `table-bordered`) for responsive and styled presentation.
- Clean and simple user interface.

🚀 How to Run:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click the "Gerar tabela" button to create the table dynamically.

Great for learning how to manipulate the DOM, create HTML elements via JavaScript, and apply Bootstrap styling.
